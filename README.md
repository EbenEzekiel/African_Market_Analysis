# AFRICAN MARKET ANALYSIS

The aim of this project was to explore the buisness and investment prospects of countries and regions in Africa
to do this,

## Web Scraping:
	I collected data from relevant unrelated sources from the web about each country in Africa

## Data Wrangling:
	I cleaned and converted collected data into useable format. They were then joined together.

## Data Analysis:
	The data was explored and visualized to reveal performance and potentials of each country
	
## Clustering:
	A kMeans clustering (machine learning) was done to reveal natural clusters within the data

## Visualization:
	I built a dash board to present the analysis and give actionable insights


## Reproducing this results:
	To get the same result gotten in this project, clone this repository into your local machine and 
	run the .py (python) files in this order:
	- webscrapping 101 (internet connection needed)
	- webscrapping 102 (internet connection needed)
	- webscrapping 103 (internet connection needed)
	- DataWrangling
	- Visualization
	
	These will cause a folder "data_folder" to be created on your local machine. Files will be written in it
